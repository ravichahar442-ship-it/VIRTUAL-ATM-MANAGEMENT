# VIRTUAL-ATM-MANAGEMENT
The ATM Management System works like a real ATM. Users enter their username and PIN to log in. After logging in, they can view account statements, withdraw cash, deposit cash, and change PINs. The system stores usernames, PINs, and account balances. It ensures cash transactions are in multiples of 10 and handles errors for wrong inputs.
